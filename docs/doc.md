## üìÑ Project Requirements Document (PRD)

### üîπ Overview
Build a transparent, crypto-powered aid distribution platform with:
- A global onchain pool split by categories (Food, Medicine, Education, Emergency)
- Admin-controlled aid approvals
- Off-chain verification, proof-of-use, and task requirements
- Clean, simple frontend showing live data and allowing donors to contribute via wallet

### üîπ Goals
- Provide a simple and transparent system for sending aid directly to those in need
- Allow collective donations with per-category tracking
- Build trust by requiring proof and small tasks for continued aid
- Keep the process efficient and human-driven off-chain while tracking all financials on-chain

### üîπ Key User Roles
- **Donor**: Sends USDC to a selected category pool
- **Receiver**: Applies for aid off-chain, receives funds on approval
- **Admin**: Verifies cases, approves aid, triggers contract calls

### üîπ Functional Requirements
- Smart contract for category-based USDC pooling and admin-controlled releases
- Frontend with:
  - Landing page
  - Live pool display
  - Wallet connect (RainbowKit)
  - Donation UI
  - Admin dashboard for triggering aid release
- Off-chain:
  - Aid request intake (Telegram/form)
  - Proof submission tracking (Notion/Airtable)
  - Task completion logic

### üîπ Non-Functional Requirements
- Highly available and performant UI
- Secure smart contracts (auditable logic)
- Clear documentation

- Clear dual CTA:
  - **"I want to help"** ‚Üí Scrolls to donation flow
